Road Accident Analysis

Executive Summary

This project involves comprehensive analysis and visualization of road accident data using Microsoft Power BI. The primary aim is to uncover critical insights related to accident severity, contributing conditions, vehicle involvement, and temporal trends. By converting raw datasets into interactive dashboards, the project demonstrates how data analytics can support informed decision-making and road safety improvements.

Business Problem

Road accidents remain a major public safety concern. Large volumes of accident data are often underutilized due to poor structuring and lack of visualization. This project addresses the challenge of transforming raw accident records into meaningful insights that can help:

Identify high-risk conditions and locations
Understand patterns in accident severity
Support data-driven safety strategies
